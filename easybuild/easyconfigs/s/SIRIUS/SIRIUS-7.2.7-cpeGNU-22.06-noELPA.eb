description = """
SIRIUS is a domain specific library for electronic structure calculations. It 
implements pseudopotential plane wave (PP-PW) and full potential linearized 
augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) methods and is designed for GPU acceleration of
popular community codes such as Exciting, Elk and Quantum ESPRESSO. SIRIUS is
written in C++14 with MPI, OpenMP and CUDA/ROCm programming models. SIRIUS is
organised as a collection of classes that abstract away the different building
blocks of DFT self-consistency cycle.

The following functionality is currently implemented in SIRIUS:

  - (PP-PW) Norm-conserving, ultrasoft and PAW pseudopotentials
  - (PP-PW) Spin-orbit coupling
  - (PP-PW) Stress tensor
  - (PP-PW, FP-LAPW) Atomic forces
  - (PP-PW, FP-LAPW) Collinear and non-collinear magnetism
  - (FP-LAPW) APW and LAPW basis sets with arbitrary number of local orbitals
  - (FP-LAPW) ZORA and IORA approximations for valence states; full relativistic 
             Dirac equation for core states
  - Symmetrization of lattice-periodic functions and on-site matrices
  - Generation of irreducible k-meshes
  - Python frontend
