# LUMI-EasyBuild-contrib

This is a repository for contributed EasyConfig files that LUMI users can install
at their own discretion or use as a starting base for their own build recipes.

Recipes in this repository are not installed centrally on LUMI, but can be installed
by users using the EasyBuild-user module, or adapted to their own needs.

These build recipes are not as carefully tested as the ones that are centrally installed
and part of the [main LUMI-SoftwareStack production repository](https://github.com/Lumi-supercomputer/LUMI-SoftwareStack),
and they are not always ported to newer versions of the software or the LUMI software
stack by us, but they can be a great source of inspiration for users to build their
own build recipes.

The structure of the repository follows the standard structure used by EasyBuild so
that it should be compatible with the github management features of EasyBuild.
